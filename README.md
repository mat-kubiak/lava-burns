## Lava Burns!

In minecraft lava is fairly dangerous, however it's nothing compared to how the real life thing works. In real life even standing close to lava is a guaranteed burn. This mod implements precisely that, making it even more risky to be in vicinity of lava and requiring the player to be even more cautious, especially in nether and especially in challenge runs.

This mod is vanilla, it doesn't add any additional item or block and works both for the client and for server, it should be a perfect pick for a challenge modpack.

## Spacial Burning
This mod makes two blocks able to burn the player from the distance: Lava block (both the source and the rest of the fluid) and a lava-filled cauldron. Player will be burned for 1 second

## Holding Items
Holding a bucket of lava should be incredibly

This effect also works underwater.

One could consider this mod an anti-quality-of-life mod, however in composition with other mods, one can create a better, fully personalized challenge modpack.
